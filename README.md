# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game – MATLAB App Designer

## 📌 Introduction

This is a simple and fun **Tic Tac Toe game** built using **MATLAB App Designer**.  
It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid, with a clean graphical interface.

This project helped me explore **GUI design**, **event-based logic**, and basic **game flow control** within MATLAB.
